# Vector-Field-Remastered-matplotlib
From the previous code of Vector Field 2D, using arrows to represent a vector field works fairly well. But matplotlib can do better than thisâ€”it can show the streamlines of a vector field. A streamline shows how the vector field flows. In this recipe, we will show you how to create streamlines. Let's use the fluid flow example of the previous recipe. You will simply replace the arrows ( the first code of vector field ) with streamlines, as shown in the following code.
